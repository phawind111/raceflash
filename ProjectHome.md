## Scope ##

Firmware extraction, and soon firmware upload tool for the PerformanceBox and DriftBox.

## Why ##

These tools can be used to develop a custom OS for those devices, as the hardware is quite
nize, a lot more than a performance meter can be built with it.
Maybe someone wants to port raceflash then to MacOS.

## Whats available ##

  * raceflash - Allows you to flash .RUF files from linux/unix, and create .RUF files from your own binaries.

  * ruf\_tools - Extract/Combine .RUF files
